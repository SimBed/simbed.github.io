title: "Control Bid"
---

After trump agreement, a new suit shows 1st **or** 2nd round control<sup>1</sup> and slam interest.<br><br>
This applies at all levels with some exceptions.<sup>2</sup><br><br>
Bid at the cheapest level so a Control Bid in a suit would deny 1st or 2nd round control in a lower ranked suit (that could have been bid but wasnâ€™t).<br><br>
<sup>1</sup> Kx is generally considered 2nd round control, though be careful if there are grounds to suppose the king will not hold (ie covered by an ace). KQx or x preferred.
