title: "Control Bid"
---

After trump agreement, a new suit shows 1st round control (ace or void) and slam interest. This applies at all levels with some exceptions.<sup>1</sup><br><br>
Bid at the cheapest level so a Control Bid in a suit would deny 1st  round control in a lower ranked suit (that could have been bid but wasnâ€™t).<br><br>

### <sup>1</sup>Notes and Exceptions for Discussion
- Trial Bids are not played. So 1&spades;-2&spades;-3<span style='color:red;'>&diams;</span> under this agreement would be a Control Bid showing a very strong, unbalanced hand (but not worth 2&clubs;) with <span style='color:red;'>&diams;</span> control, but not club control. However this is of limited usefulness as a non 2&clubs; opening bid against parnter's simple raise doesn not seem destined for slam - perhaps there is a better use for this bid... e.g. diamond shortage, game invitational)
- Inverted Minors. 1&clubs;-2&clubs;-2<font style='color:red;'>&diams;</font>/2<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;</font>/2&spades;. See Response to [Inverted Minors]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _conventions/InvertedMinor.markdown %}).
