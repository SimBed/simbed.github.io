After trump agreement, a new suit shows 1st **or** 2nd round control and slam interest.<sup>1</sup>.<br><br>
Bid at the cheapest level so a Control Bid in a suit would deny 1st or 2nd round control in a lower ranked suit (that could have been bid but wasnâ€™t).<br><br>
<sup>1</sup> Kx is considered 2nd round control, though KQx or x preferred.
