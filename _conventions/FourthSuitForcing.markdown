title: "4th suit forcing"
---

4th Suit Forcing is an artificial game-forcing bid by responsder (on the fourth bid) of the partnership's previously unbid fourth suit (i.e the first 3 bids were all of different suits). It does not necessarily show or deny the actual suit bid.

### Example

| North | East | South | West
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1<font style='color:red;'>&diams;</font> | - | 1&spades; | -
| 2&clubs; | - | 2<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;</font><sup>1</sup> | 

<sup>1</sup>artificial, 12+ points. May or may not have <font style='color:red;'>&hearts;</font>s.
<br><br>

### System is off:

 - after opener's reverse. Any bid other than blackout is game-forcing so 4th suit forcing is redundant.
 - after opener's jump shift.
 - in competition
