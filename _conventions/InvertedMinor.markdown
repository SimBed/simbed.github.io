a single raise of a 1&clubs;/1<font style='color:red;'>&diams;</font> opening bid is strong and a jump raise is pre-emptive and weak

<br>

## Response to 1 of a minor

### Single Raise (strong)

<table >
  <tr>
    <th><i>West</i></th>
    <th><i>North</i></th>
    <th><i>East</i></th>
    <th><i>Meaning</i></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1&clubs;</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>2&clubs;</td>
    <td>10+ points<sup>1</sup>, no 4 card major, 4+&clubs;s, forcing. Unbalanced<sup>2</sup></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<sup>1</sup> no upper limit on point count<br>
<sup>2</sup> a no trump bid would normally be preferred when balanced 

### Jump Raise (very weak)
<table >
  <tr>
    <th><i>West</i></th>
    <th><i>North</i></th>
    <th><i>East</i></th>
    <th><i>Meaning</i></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1&clubs;</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>3&clubs;</td>
    <td>0-6 points, 5+&clubs;s, (does not deny 4 card major)<sup>1</sup></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<sup>1</sup>Bridgebase states no 4 card major. Drop this requirement
<br><br>

### Be Aware
weak (7-9) points and 4 card support isn't represented in this convention, so defaulting to an unbalanced 1NT may sometimes be necessary


## Opener's rebids

### Opener's rebid after 2&clubs; raise

| Overcall | Meaning |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 2<font style='color:red;'>&diams;</font> | stopper showing, forcing<sup>1</sup>
| 2<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;</font>/2&spades; | stopper-showing, forcing
| 2NT | Balanced 12-14 points
| 3&clubs; | Natural (5+), not forcing
| 3<font style='color:red;'>&diams;</font> | Natural, forcing [perhaps strong (maybe 6-4 in minors, but no major stoppers] 
| 3NT | Balanced 18-19 points

<sup>1</sup> natural and unbalanced per bridgebums seems unhelpful.<br><br>
