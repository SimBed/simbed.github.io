title: "Negative Double"
---

Most commonly used by responder to show an unbid major with a hand not suitable to bid the major directly (too short or too weak). 

### Examples

| Opener | Overcall | Response | Meaning |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1&clubs; | 1<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;</font> | Dbl | 6+ points, exactly 4&spades;s (1&spades; would show 5+&spades;s) |
| 1&clubs; | 1&spades; | Dbl | 6+ points, 4**+**<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;</font>s (note the **+** here -  it *can* show 5<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;</font>s (and weak), as there is no room for a comparable bid to 1&spades; shown above) |
| 1&clubs; | 1<font style='color:red;'>&diams;</font> | Dbl | 6+ points, exactly 4-4 in the majors |
| 1<font style='color:red;'>&diams;</font> | 2&clubs; | Dbl | 6+ points, at least one 4+ major <br> (can't have 5 card major _and_ 10+ points) |
| 1<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;</font> | 2<font style='color:red;'>&diams;</font> | Dbl | 4&spades;s and 6+ points *OR* 5+&spades;s and 6-9 points <br> (denies heart support) |
| 1<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;</font> | 1&spades; | Dbl | 6+ points, at least 4-4 in the minors <br> (denies heart support) |
