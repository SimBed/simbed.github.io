title: "Texas Transfers"
---

6+ of a major with game (but not slam) interest after partners 1NT.

### Standard
- Texas Transfers apply after 1NT and 2NT opening. Opener _must_ complete the transfer
- 1NT-4<font style='color:red;'>&diams;</font>-4<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;
- 1NT-4<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;</font>-4&spades;
- 2NT-4<font style='color:red;'>&diams;</font>-4<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;
- 2NT-4<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;</font>-4&spades;

### In Competition
- Transfers _do_ apply after 1NT overcall
- Transfers remain _on_ after opponent double
- Transfers are _off_ after opponents bid a suit (a more sophisitcated version is too easy to get wrong, so keep it simple and consistent with Jacoby)
