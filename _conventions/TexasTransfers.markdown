title: "Texas Transfers"
---

6+ of a major with game (but not slam<sup>1</sup>) interest after partners 1NT.

### Standard
- Texas Transfers apply after 1NT and 2NT opening. Opener _must_ complete the transfer
- 1NT-4<font style='color:red;'>&diams;</font>-4<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;
- 1NT-4<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;</font>-4&spades;
- 2NT-4<font style='color:red;'>&diams;</font>-4<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;
- 2NT-4<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;</font>-4&spades;

### In Competition
- Transfers _do_ apply after 1NT overcall
- Transfers remain _on_ after opponent double
- Transfers are _off_ after opponents bid a suit (a more sophisitcated version is too easy to get wrong, so keep it simple and consistent with Jacoby)

<br>

### <sup>1</sup>Slam Bidding
With 6+ of a major and slam interest, start with a Jacoby Transfer and follow up with a forcing rebid. This is probably the more effective way to find slam, but any follow-on bid to a Texas Transfer response (althtough technically off-system) should be easy to interpret.

1NT-4<font style='color:red;'>&hearts;-</font>4&spades;-4NT (...i probably should have used a Jacoby Transfer earlier, but RKCB, spades trumps).
