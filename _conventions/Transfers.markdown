### Standard
- Transfers apply after 1NT and 2NT opening. Opener _must_ complete the transfer
- 2&spades; shows long clubs or diamonds and must be transferred to 3&clubs;

### In Competition
- Transfers _do_ apply after 1NT overcall
- Transfers remain _on_ after opponent double
- Transfers are _off_ after opponents bid a suit

<br>

### Incorrect Bidding Example

 <img src="/assets/images/incorrect transfer.png" style="width:60%;">

 West's 4&spades; risks a 7 card fit. 3NT instead allows East to determine the final game contract aware that partner has the points for game and exactly 5 spades. (Stayman for 4, Texas for 6+ were not used).
 The 4&spades; bid should mean 6+&spades;s and slam interest.
