I play on [BridgeBase](https://www.bridgebase.com/) under the name SimBed

## Preferred System:
- 5 card major
- with Multicolour 2<font style='color:red;'>&diams;</font> with Muiderberg
- and conventions as set out on this site

<!-- ## Principle of Parsimony
"Only introduce an adaptation to a bidding system if the gains when perfectly executed can be expected to offest the losses when imperfectly executed." The 'biting point' is completely subjective and application will be entirely down to partnership to determine. -->
