I play on BridgeBase under the name SimBed

## Preferred System:
- 5 card major
- Multi 2d with Muiderberg
- and all (and no other) systems as set out on this site

## Principle of Parsimony
"Only introduce an adaptation to a bidding system if the gains when perfectly executed can be expected to offest the losses when imperfectly executed."<br><br> ie a theroretically sound system that rarely occurs, gives tiny improvement and is non-intuitive, easy to get wrong under pressure and likey to result in complete breakdown in communication when applied wrongly may be better avoided, unless zealously studied and practised by both partners. This is completely subjective and application will be entirely down to partnership to determine.
